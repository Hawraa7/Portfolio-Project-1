### Bugs

Solved bugs 
- When I deployed my project to Github Pges, I discovered ma project was broken, the links to the other files (CSS and images) did not work.

- I discovered this was because I had used absolute file paths such as this is my code 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">

- Removing the starting / fixed the problem.
